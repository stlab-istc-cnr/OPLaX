# OPLaX

This is OPLaX (Ontology Pattern Language eXtended), the extended version of the OPLa ontology, which includes: 

- annotation properties from the original OPLa ontology (Pascal Hitzler et al., Towards a simple but useful Ontology Design Pattern Representation Language, WOP 2017 - https://github.com/cogan-shimizu/Extended-OPLa/blob/master/oplacore.owl); 
- annotation properties from the Content Pattern annotation schema (http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/schemas/cpannotationschema.owl) used in the [ODP Portal](http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/);
- additional annotation properties for addressing the instance level (an instance of a pattern) and the conceptual component level (an abstract conceptual component grouping different patterns addressing it).
